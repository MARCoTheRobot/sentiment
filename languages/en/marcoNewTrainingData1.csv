,I am so freaking excited,My dog died today,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Work went by in a breeze and I got so much done,We had to go to my grandma's funeral,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,I feel highly motivated,My grandfather died,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"It's like, since we started getting some more customers, I now have more hope for everything", I don’t know what to do and I constantly feel like I’m going to cry,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,I definitely had more hope for how it was going to go,And I don't feel good either,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,But then I got my second wind and started running and pushing even harder," I either just lay on some piece of furniture and fail to get up, or surf the net looking for something that feels social, or if I'm lucky I can force myself to do some long, sedentary technical activity with tv in the background for company, like knitting or coloring or luckily paperwork for my job",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Bro I am so close to reaching my goal of a 1600,I hate seeing my old classmates living their lives and prospering as I stay at home all day everyday doing absolutely nothing,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,I have been studying hard every day and working hard and pulling my ass off to get this done,I wish my chest was flatter.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Literally I cannot tell you how proud I am to present this tomorrow,I wish my body would match how I see myself in my mind.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,I finished my rendering and it looks amazing!,"I'm happy I started transitioning, but I sometimes doubt whether it was the right choice.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,the party is tonight and I just cannot wait,I wish I wasn't so awkward around people.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Honestly I'm pretty excited to get up there and present my findings at this year's ICEE conference,Who could love someone as messed up as me?,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,I've really been looking forward to playing this concert,"I miss spending weekends at my grandfather's, I still can't believe I won't see him again",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,How do I tell them that I'm really excited about the idea of moving out to Maryland?,"I'll find myself questioning my relationship with my wife, with my family, the purpose of my life, why I make efforts to accomplish anything",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I had my coffee, my favorite playlist going, and I was ready to get some work done.","I tend to just drift through the day doing the bare minimum, and I tend to make decisions or do things because I should",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,Ready as I'll ever be,"So I immediately started feeling depressed and anxious and yelled fuck fuck fuck fuck over and over again for several minutes",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I've put in the effort and what I'm going to do I will do, no matter how easy or hard",Then I just gave up on MARCo and started working,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,I was looking forward to trying out the different tools,"First group: I don't have a stable income, coronavirus is making it difficult to have a normal life, and I am stuck at home",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,I stayed up until 2 in the morning because I was just so laser focused on getting this app launched,"Second group: I feel purposeless in everything I do, and I feel like I have no control over my faith and am stupid",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,We are making good progress and I felt super inspired!,"It crushes me down now, so how could I successfully keep it going a year from now",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,I am inspired,She makes me feel worthless when I'm not able to provide her with everything she wants when she wants it,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,I have felt very inspired and productive,"
I don't know how to keep a friend and I don't know how to want to have friends",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"I have been super motivated, productive, and inspired lately"," I tend to withdraw, cancel plans, and I prefer to just stay in and be by myself",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,"It's finally at a point where I get to do the fun work, the work I like doing", I suffered with depression for many years during this time and rarely go out or speak to people,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,This work has been super easy and I've been breezing through it,It's like I'll never escape these student loans.,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
," I can be a total busy bee if I have people around me and interacting with me, I thrive in a commune type environment, if I'm working in a team I get shit done",I stayed in bed all day,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,Took a depression nap for a few hours,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,I don't see things getting better,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,My sister has a boyfriend but I'm all alone,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,No boy is ever going to like me,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,No girl will ever love me again,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,I miss her so much,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,I miss feeling loved,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,I am so depressed,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,I have been struggling with severe depression,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
,,I don't feel like I want to live anymore,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
